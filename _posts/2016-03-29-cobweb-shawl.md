Cobweb Baby Shawl.

I was asked to make a baby christening shawl and the customer asked for the[Cobweb Lace Christening Shawl from Jamieson & Smith][0]. The problem was the pattern was written so I had to chart it before I could start. Once done things became a lot easier. :-)

15th April It is finished and I am pleased with the end result.

4th April 16 This is 63% of the shawl done. It gets quicker as the rows are getting shorter. :-) ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d81f040c-a70d-49d0-9846-dd18f38578ba.jpg)

The corner and you can just see the rose. Still not sure if the rose was worth the effort as the whole thing will look a lot better when it has been blocked out.

19th March 16 - The is the start of the rose pattern. It is not as bad as I imagined once you have got used to doing the pips

4th March 16 - The body has been attached to the edging. You had to pick up the stitch all along the inside, 784 in total. This is one of the four corners.
