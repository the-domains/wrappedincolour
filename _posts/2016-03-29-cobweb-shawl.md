Cobweb Baby Shawl.

I was asked to make a baby christening shawl and the customer asked for the[Cobweb Lace Christening Shawl from Jamieson & Smith][0]. The problem was the pattern was written so I had to chart it before I could start. Once done things became a lot easier. :-)

4th March 16 - The body has been attached to the edging. You had to pick up the stitch all along the inside, 784 in total. This is one of the four corners.
